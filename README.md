## Quick Start

### Without Traefik (Manual Services Only)

The application automatically detects if Traefik is available. Simply don't configure it:

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd HomeLab-Dashboard
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Leave TRAEFIK_API_URL empty (already empty in .env.example)
# No configuration needed! App automatically uses manual mode.

# 3. Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Initialize
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# 5. Access at http://localhost:8000
# 6. Click "➕ Add Service" to add your services!
```

### Docker with Traefik (Recommended)

If you have Traefik, just configure the URL and the app will automatically detect it:

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd HomeLab-Dashboard
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env and set your Traefik API URL
nano .env
# Set: TRAEFIK_API_URL=http://your-traefik:8080/api

# 3. Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Initialize
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# 5. Access at http://localhost:8000
# Services will be automatically discovered!
```

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure and initialize
cp .env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py sync_services

# 3. Run server
python manage.py runserver
```

See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions.

## Screenshots

The dashboard displays your services as cards showing:
- Service name and icon
- Current status (Up/Down/Unknown)
- Service type and provider
- Response time
- Tags and metadata
- Direct link to service URL

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Press 'R'** - Refresh all services (when not typing in input fields)

## Requirements

- **Docker Method**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Local Method**: Python 3.12+
- **Optional**: Traefik with API enabled (for auto-discovery)

## Key Features

### Flexible URL Input
Add services easily with flexible URL formats:
- `plex.example.com` - Protocol added automatically
- `192.168.1.100:8080` - IP addresses with ports supported
- `http://service.local` - Explicit protocol preserved
- **Smart fallback**: Tries HTTPS first, falls back to HTTP if needed

### Smart API Detection
- Automatically detects service APIs
- Throttles detection after 5 failed attempts (retries every 5 minutes)
- Reduces log spam and network traffic

### Automatic Mode Detection
- No manual configuration for Traefik enable/disable
- Seamlessly switches between Traefik and manual mode
- Works out of the box whether you have Traefik or not
